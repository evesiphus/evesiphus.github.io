I am an assistant professor (Enseignante-chercheurse)  within the Information, Communications and Imaging (ICI) group of [ETIS](https://www.etis-lab.fr/) (UMR8051 â€“ a joint research laboratory between CY Cergy Paris University, ENSEA and CNRS) since September 2024.

Bio
======
Before joining [CYU](https://www.cyu.fr/), I served as a PostDoc at [Lincs Lab](https://www.lincs.fr/), working with Prof. Leonardo Linguaglossa, while being co-affiliated with the Department of Network and Computer Science (INFRES) at [Telecom Paris](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/en/school/departments/computer-science-networks), at [the Institute Polytechnique de Paris](https://www.ip-paris.fr/en), from 2022 to 2024. During this period, I collaborated with the Nokia Bell Lab Research center, particularly with the guidance of senior researcher Dr. Tianzhu Zhang.
