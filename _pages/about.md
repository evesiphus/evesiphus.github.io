<br>

I am currently serving as an Assistant Professor at [CY Cergy Paris University](https://www.cyu.fr/), a position I have held since September 2024. I am involved with both the Computer Science Department at CYU, where I focus on teaching, and the [ETIS](https://www.etis-lab.fr/) group, a joint research research lab among CYU, ENSEA, and CNRS. Specifically, I am a permanent member of the ICI (Information, Communication, and Imaging) team within ETIS.


## Bio

Before joining [CYU](https://www.cyu.fr/) in 2024, I worked as a Postdoctoral Researcher at [Lincs Lab](https://www.lincs.fr/) under the supervision of Prof. Leonardo Linguaglossa, co-affiliated with the INFRES Department at [Télécom Paris](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/en/school/departments/computer-science-networks), [Institut Polytechnique de Paris](https://www.ip-paris.fr/en). I also collaborated with Nokia Bell Labs under the guidance of Dr. Tianzhu Zhang.

I obtained my Ph.D. in 2022 from [INSA Rennes](https://www.insa-rennes.fr/ietr-1.html), in the IETR lab (CNRS 6164), supervised by [Prof. Philippe Mary](https://pmary.perso.insa-rennes.fr/) and [Prof. Jean-Yves Baudais](http://jeanyves.baudais.free.fr/).

I hold an M.Sc. in Telecommunications from [Xidian University](https://www.xidian.edu.cn/) and a B.Sc. in Electronic Information Science and Technology from [Shandong University](https://www.en.sdu.edu.cn/).
