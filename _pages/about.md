I am an associate professor at  [CY Cergy Paris University](https://www.cyu.fr/)  and a mumber of  ETIS laboratory [ETIS(UMR8051)](https://www.etis-lab.fr/).

I'm always looking for highly motivated Ph.D., master, undergraduate students, interns interested in AI, networking, or  large-cellular networks for collaborating. Besides, experience of __stochastic geometry__ or __deep reinforcement learning__ is a strong plus. Feel free to send me an email with your CV if you are interested.

Bio
======
Before joining [CYU](https://www.cyu.fr/), I worked as a PostDoc at [Lincs lab](https://www.lincs.fr/), and co-affilicated with the Department of Network and Computer Science Department (INFRES), [Telecom Paris](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/en/school/departments/computer-science-networks), at [the Institute Polytechnique de Paris](https://www.ip-paris.fr/en) from 2022-2024. 

Prior to that,  I received my Ph.D in 06/2022 at IETR, CNRS 6164 group of [INSA Rennes](https://www.insa-rennes.fr/ietr-1.html) under the supervision of [Prof. Philippe Mary](https://pmary.perso.insa-rennes.fr/) and [Prof. Jean-Yves Baudais](http://jeanyves.baudais.free.fr/). 

I obtained my M.Sc. of telecommunication from [Xidian University](https://www.xidian.edu.cn/), China and my B.Sc. of Electronic Information Science and Technology from [Shandong University](https://www.en.sdu.edu.cn/), China.
