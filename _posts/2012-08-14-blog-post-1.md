### Applied AI/ML for High-Speed Software Networks
- **Non-intrusive network measurement**: Instead of directly collecting packet- and flow-level features, we explore the low-level hardware features ubiquitously available in modern commodity hardware, such as the CPU cores, multi-level caches, memory subsystem, and PCIe buses, which have minimal impact on normal network operations.
- **Performance diagnosis**: We develop predictive models to infer performance impairments and deduce the associated bottlenecks in high-speed NFV data plane.
- **Performance optimization**: We implement a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based framework to pinpoint resource contentions at runtime and automatically adjust the Last-level Cache allocation to optimize the end-to-end service performance, e.g., throughput, latency, and energy efficiency.

### Proactive VNF Redeployment and Traffic Routing (VRTR)
- We apply an entropy measure to gauge the uncertainty in the substrate network.
- We formulate the VRTR problem with a compact matrix representation, which can be efficiently solved, even in large-scale networks with high traffic loads.
- We develop a proactive algorithm to cognitively update the service placement scheme, traffic routing rules, and redeployment interval.

### Operationalizing AI/ML in Future Networks
- We identify the major obstacles to adopting AI/ML in real networks across the product lifecycle and investigate system-related aspects of implementing these technologies in real networks.
- We aim to merge DevOps and ML practices as MLOps to streamline the data collection, development, deployment, and management of AI/ML-based solutions in real network systems.

### Modulation and Coding Schemes Based on Stochastic Geometry in Downlink Cellular Networks
- We study the situation in which each SINR region corresponds to an MCS scheme with a fixed number of channels, and different SINR regions meet a corresponding rate \(R\). We deviated the average rate and the stable probability if a network has an average arrival traffic rate.

### In-network AI/ML for Cybersecurity
- **Botnet Analysis**: We analyze real-world bot traffic traces and employ AI/ML techniques to pinpoint the most relevant features for botnet detection.
- **In-network AI/ML for Botnet Detection**: We introduce In-network Caching Shelter (INCS), an in-network ML solution implemented on NVIDIA BlueField-2 Data Processing Units.
