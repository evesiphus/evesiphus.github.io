- **Non-intrusive network measurement**: Instead of directly collecting packet- and flow-level features, we explore the low-level hardware features ubiquitously available in modern commodity hardware, such as the CPU cores, multi-level caches, memory subsystem, and PCIe buses, which have minimal impact on normal network operations.
- **Performance diagnosis**: We develop predictive models to infer performance impairments and deduce the associated bottlenecks in high-speed NFV data plane.
- **Performance optimization**: We implement a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based framework to pinpoint resource contentions at runtime and automatically adjust the Last-level Cache allocation to optimize the end-to-end service performance, e.g., throughput, latency, and energy efficiency.
